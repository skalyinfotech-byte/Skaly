                                The word ‘NAKSHA’ portrays a plan and a visualisation of a space which represents all the internal areas of a property with proper dimensions ensuring space utilisation and a perfect planning.
                                A plan which permutes your ideas into visuals so that your notion gets clear regarding your "Home Sweet Home"
                                <br>
                                NAKSHA enables you to understand the relationships between rooms and proximity.
                                The process of Interior Designing does not start and end without a proper NAKSHA of your space.
                                Hence, we give utmost importance to planning for a healthy and a better living.<br>
